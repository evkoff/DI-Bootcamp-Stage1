Challenge 1: Multiples of a Number


Key Python Topics:
input() function
Loops (for or while)
Lists and appending items
Basic arithmetic (multiplication)


Instructions:
1. Ask the user for two inputs:

A number (integer).
A length (integer).
2. Create a program that generates a list of multiples of the given number.
3. The list should stop when it reaches the length specified by the user.

Example 1:

Input:

number: 7
length: 5
Output:
[7, 14, 21, 28, 35]



Example 2:

Input:

number: 12
length: 10
Output:
[12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]



Example 3:

Input:

number: 17
length: 6
Output:
[17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]
"""


number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
length = int(input("Enter the length: "))

multiples = []
counter = 1

while len(multiples) < length:
    result = number * counter
    multiples.append(result)
    counter += 1

print(multiples)




"""
Challenge 2: Remove Consecutive Duplicate Letters


Key Python Topics:
input() function
Strings and string manipulation
Loops (for or while)
Conditional statements (if)


Instructions:
1. Ask the user for a string.
2. Write a program that processes the string to remove consecutive duplicate letters.

The new string should only contain unique consecutive letters.
For example, “ppoeemm” should become “poem” (removes consecutive duplicates like ‘pp’, ‘ee’, and ‘mm’).
3. The program should print the modified string.



Example 1:

Input:
user’s word: "ppoeemm"
Output:
"poem"


Example 2:

Input:
user’s word: "wiiiinnnnd"
Output:
"wind"


Example 3:

Input:
user’s word: "ttiiitllleeee"
Output:
"title"


Example 4:

Input:
user’s word: "cccccaaarrrbbonnnnn"
Output:
"carbon"


Notes:
The final string will not include any consecutive duplicates, but non-consecutive duplicates are allowed.
Example: In "recursive", the two ‘r’s and two ‘e’s are allowed because they are not consecutive.
